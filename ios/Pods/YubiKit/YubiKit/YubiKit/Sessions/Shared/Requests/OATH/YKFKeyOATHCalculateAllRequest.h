 @class YKFKeyOATHCalculateAllRequest
 
 @abstract
    Request for calculating all OATH credentials saved on the key. This request maps to the
    CALCULATE ALL command from YOATH protocol:
    https://developers.yubico.com/OATH/YKOATH_Protocol.html
 
 @discussion
    This calculates only TOTP credentials and returns the labels for HOTP credentials to avoid
    overloading the HOTP counters.
 
    Calculate All assumes that all TOTP credentials have a period of 30 seconds (default period)
    because the key command receives only one time challenge. For TOTP credentials which have a
    different period an explicit calculate request with the right period challenge needs to be
    performed afterwards.
